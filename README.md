#pyrsync
===============================
pyrsync is a Python module which implements the [rsync algorithm] [1],
written in pure Python. It *is not* a wrapper for rsync, but a set of
functions which apply full rsync functionality through Python.

The majority of the code for this module is taken from [Eric Pruitt's
post at ActiveState] [2]. It was orginally licensed under an [MIT license]
[3], and this license has been kept wthout modifications.

## Installation
--------------------------------
If you have [setuptools] [4] installed, simply do:

    $ sudo python setup.py install

If you do not have setuptools, the setup.py script will detect this and
default to using the python builtin distutils. To install using distutils,
the installation process is the same as documented above for setuptools.

## Use
--------------------------------
An example use case for this module:

    # On the system containing the file that needs to be patched
    >>> import pyrsync
    >>> unpatched = open("unpatched.file", "rb")
    >>> hashes = pyrsync.blockchecksums(unpatched)

    # On the remote system after having received hashes
    >>> import pyrsync
    >>> patchedfile = open("patched.file", "rb")
    >>> delta = pyrsync.rsyncdelta(patchedfile, hashes)

    # System with the unpatched file after receiving delta
    >>> unpatched.seek(0)
    >>> save_to = open("locally-patched.file", "wb")
    >>> pyrsync.patchstream(unpatched, save_to, delta)
